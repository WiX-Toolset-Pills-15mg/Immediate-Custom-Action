        Step 2: Reference the custom action library
        
        A reference to the library file (.CA.dll file) that contains the custom actions must be created.
        
        A custom actions project for WiX created in C# will generate two files:
            - "<name>.dll" - a normal .NET class library assembly.
            - "<name>.CA.dll" - a wrapper over the previously created .NET assembly that can be consumed by Windows Installer.
        This trick is needed because, natively, Windows Installer cannot consume .NET assemblies.

        Step 3: Create the custom action.
        
        The custom action refers the static method previously implemented in C#.
