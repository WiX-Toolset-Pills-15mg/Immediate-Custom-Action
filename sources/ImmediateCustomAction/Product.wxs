            Step 4: Add custom action to the execution sequence
            ====================================================================================================
            
            The order in which the custom actions are executed is specified using the "After" or "Before" attributes.
            These attributes help placing the new custom action relative to another existing one,
            in this example, it is placed after the action called "InstallFiles".
