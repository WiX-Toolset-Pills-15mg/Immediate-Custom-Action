# Immediate Custom Action

## Description

This pill demonstrates how to create an immediate custom action.

An immediate custom action is executed exactly where it is placed in the install  sequence, as opposed to a deferred custom action that is just put in a list and it is executed at the end of the install sequence.

## Content

### a) Tutorial (article)

A step-by-step tutorial can be found in the [doc/article/README.md](doc/article/README.md) document. You can find there explanations on solving the described problem.

### b) Code example

The complete Visual Studio solution that solves the described problem can be found in the [sources](sources) directory.

### c) Code notes

A shorter version of the tutorial can be found directly in the source code. Open Visual Studio solution and search (Ctrl+Shift+F) for the `START` comment, then follow the `Step` comments.

**Note:** The `NEXT` tags at the end of each comment indicates the file where to search for the next `Step`.

### d) Log file examples

Sometimes a quick look into the log files may be necessary, but running the installer each time may be cumbersome. I generated the log files for the meaningful scenarios and I placed them into the [doc/logs](doc/logs) directory. Use them when needed.
